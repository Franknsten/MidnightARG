If the world is made out of love 
Then the pain is proof that it isn’t done
When you’re empty you can use me up
You won’t run out there is love enough 

Everybody wants to walk away sometimes
Some believe they can fly
Either way, 
Coming down is still a hell of a ride

If you can feel your heartbeat 
You’re not done yet 
You can’t be 
If it hurts, it’s working 
There is love enough 
For you and me 

If the world is made out of love 
Then a heart can change in anyone 
I was nearly dead when you shared your cup
You’re the proof to me there is love enough 

Everybody wants to walk away sometimes
Fools believe they can fly 
Either way 
Coming down is still a hell of a ride 

If you can feel your heartbeat 
You’re not done yet 
You can’t be 
If it hurts, it’s working 
There is love enough 
For you and me

If you can feel your heartbeat 
You’re not done yet 
Just keep going 
There is love enough 
For you and me

If the world is made out of us, 
All our shadows suggest a sun 
Every desert heart that wants the flood Come and bring your need 
There is love enough

Keep going ‘cause we can’t go back
Keep going ‘cause we can’t go back
Keep going ‘cause we can’t go back 

If you can feel your heartbeat
You’re not done yet 
You can’t be 
If it hurts, it’s working 
There is love enough 
For you and me

If you can feel your heartbeat 
You’re not done yet 
Just keep going 
There is love enough 
For you and me
